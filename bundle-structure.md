<h1>Pack structure</h1>
<p class="lede">A <code>.foundrypack</code> is a standard macOS-style bundle. Foundry keeps it intact and runs its components directly from their packaged locations.</p>


<div markdown="1">

```text
Example.foundrypack/
└── Contents/
    ├── Info.plist
    └── Resources/
        ├── component.html
        ├── component.css
        ├── editor.css
        ├── component.js
        ├── icon.svg
        └── assets/
```

</div>


<h2>What goes where</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Contents/Info.plist</dt>
<dd>Identity, templates, inspector controls and slots.</dd>
<dt>Contents/Resources</dt>
<dd>All templates, assets and nested <code>.foundrypack</code> bundles. Paths declared in <code>Info.plist</code> are relative to this directory.</dd>
<dt>icon.svg</dt>
<dd>A square component icon placed directly in Resources. Foundry discovers this filename by convention.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Components and collections</h2>
<p>A pack is a functional component by default and may also contain child packs. A non-functional outer pack used only to group child packs has an Info.plist containing exactly <code>collection = true</code>; it does not repeat component identity or template keys.</p>
<div class="note">
<strong>No extraction step.</strong> Installing an outer pack preserves its complete tree. Nested components continue to run from inside it.</div>
<h2>Development packs</h2>
<p>Rename a pack from <code>.foundrypack</code> to <code>.foundrydevpack</code> while developing it. The internal structure and <code>Info.plist</code> API remain identical, but macOS treats the development form as an ordinary folder instead of a Finder package.</p>
<p>Open the development pack with Foundry, or place it in <code>~/Library/Application Support/Foundry/Packs</code> alongside installed third-party packs. Foundry automatically loads development packs found there when it launches and watches them in place. A development pack opened from another location is also used directly without copying.</p>
<p>Changes mark the pack as needing a reload; Foundry performs one coalesced reload when the app next becomes active, then rerenders open canvases. If an edit temporarily makes the pack invalid, Foundry reports diagnostics and keeps the last valid component available.</p>
<div class="note">
<strong>Nested distribution packs are opaque.</strong> A <code>.foundrydevpack</code> watcher ignores child <code>.foundrypack</code> bundles and everything inside them. Nested <code>.foundrydevpack</code> source remains watchable.</div>
<div class="note">
<strong>Same identifier, development copy wins.</strong> An open development pack may use the same <code>id</code> as an installed pack; Foundry uses the development copy for the current session.</div>
<h2>Declared resources</h2>
<p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP template files are named under <a href="templates.html"><code>templates</code></a>. These are the only accepted template-file extensions. Other package files referenced with <code>{{ asset.… }}</code> must be listed under <a href="manifest-resources.html"><code>assets</code></a>. Sass and SCSS files are not currently compiled or accepted as template files.</p>
